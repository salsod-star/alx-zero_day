# Getting started with git
One of the unavoidable tools for a software engineer is a version control. It is really nice getting comfortable using this tool - I mean manipulating files then pushing it online for many to see is a great feeling on its own, add that to actually building something with your skills and make it easily accessible online for others to contribute or use for free. Not only that, using git brings you closer to the workings of your PC.
